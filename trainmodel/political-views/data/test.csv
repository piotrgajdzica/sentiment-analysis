Democrat,pedropierluisi,Exhorto al Gob de PR a q estudie de cerca PROMESA y se asegure de cumplir con las disposiciones q son efectivas desde q entre en vigor
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Hay muchas personas q quieren ayudar a PR y que trabajaron para lograr la aprobación de PROMESA, por lo q cuentan con mi profunda gratitud."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Ahora se están llevando a cabo 3 votaciones relacionadas a Puerto Rico, culminando con votación final sobre PROMESA. https://t.co/C6ahmHmuGc"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Al momento, el proyecto se encuentra ante la consideración del Senado y se espera q baje a votación la semana próxima, previo al 1 de julio"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA le provee a PR un mecanismo amplio para reestructurar la deuda avalado por el Dpto del Tesoro y crea una Junta de Supervisión
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Da comienzo el foro sobre #PROMESA en Washington, dc Véalo aquí-  https://t.co/Fy2KlBntt4 @amprog"
https://t.co/ejx0yFuyw5"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,El significado práctico es claro: le corresponde únicamente al Congreso otorgarle al Gob de PR la facultad para reestructurar sus deudas.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...dado que el Gobierno de Puerto Rico busca poder proveerle a los residentes de la Isla una calidad de vida comparable a la de los estados
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Por ejemplo, la disposición sobre el salario mínimo es desacertada.Apoyo la enmienda de la Congresista Torres para eliminarla del proyecto."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Si el Gobierno de PR hace las cosas bien, la Junta tendrá un rol muy limitado y cesará sus operaciones en pocos años."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Alrededor de las 3pm se reanuda la discusión de las enmiendas tras lo cual iniciará el debate general. El voto final será entre 5pm y 6pm.
